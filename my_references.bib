@phdthesis{Diss_Huehn_2013,
	Abstract = {{IEEE} 802.11 ({WiFi)} networks are used to provide Internet access anywhere anytime. However, their performance is far below the achievable limits when multiple participants share the same frequency spectrum in an uncoordinated manner. The major reason behind such inefficiency is the lack of practical resource allocation algorithms that adapt well to the current conditions in a wireless network dynamically and select the appropriate transmission parameters such as transmission rates and power levels. Most current practical schemes are rather simplistic and only change a single transmission parameter. For instance, Transmit Power Control ({TPC)} works at the {WiFi} {PHY} layer and commonly assigns a static and rather high power level to all packets. A per-link or packet scheme is expected to provide better performance, but typically increases complexity and requires higher-layer information, such as medium access state from the Medium Access Control ({MAC)} layer. Therefore, although performance improvements have been shown in theory, these ideas are largely uninvestigated in practice. In this thesis, our main goal is to understand the feasibility and performance impact of a joint and per-link rate and power controller in a real {WiFi} system. To this end, we first enabled cross-layer communication of transmission power between the {WiFi} {PHY} and {MAC} layers in the Linux mac80211 subsystem. Based on our Atheros {WiFi} hardware, we also developed the in-kernel monitoring tool {`RegMon'} that enables understanding and troubleshooting {MAC} and {PHY-layer} operations with a finegrained time resolution across different Linux drivers. We designed and implemented a distributed rate and power control algorithm, Minstrel-Blues, which does not rely on signal strength or channel state information, but uses local statistics from periodic sampling of different rate and power combinations. Essentially, Minstrel-Blues can run on any {WiFi} hardware that supports packet-level power and rate control capabilities. Minstrel Blues decides the datarate, and consequently, the minimum power-level to support the chosen rate using a two-attribute utility function based on the throughput and power consumption of all rates. To expose the trade-off between throughput and network interference, we also introduced a weight parameter for the utility function, which tunes the importance of throughput in utility decisions. Our results show that if the goal is on maximizing the per-link throughput, Minstrel-Blues can significantly reduce transmission power necessary to communicate per link, while maintaining the same throughput achieved with maximum transmit power. We call this mode of operation - Minstrel-Piano. Based on experiments in {BOWL}, at {5Ghz}, Minstrel-Piano shows significant overall throughput enhancements due to increasing spatial reuse. Our performance analysis concludes with experiments with different weight factors in a home network scenario, with 2-laptops and one access point. These experiments were run in the 2.4 {GHz} {ISM} band, and hence, they also show that our controller works well in an typical scenarios. As more and more {WiFi} Access Points are deployed and with upcoming {IEEE} 802.11 n and ac devices using wider channel widths, resource allocation is expected to become even more important to manage interference efficiently. To this end, our work significantly contributes to the understanding of rate, power and carrier-sense control in practice., Die weite Verbreitung heutiger {IEEE} 802.11 ({WiFi)} Systeme untermauert das gro{\ss}e Potential dezentraler Funknetzwerke nahezu {\"u}berall und zu jeder Zeit einen Internetzugang bereitstellen zu k{\"o}nnen. Jedoch besteht eine signifikante Differenz zwischen der theoretisch m{\"o}glichen und derzeit erreichten Daten{\"u}bertragungsleistung, wenn sich mehrere Benutzer gemeinsam einen Funkkanal teilen. Eine der Hauptursachen liegt in der ineffizienten Ausnutzung des Frequenzspektrums begr{\"u}ndet. Es fehlen praxisnahe Algorithmen zur dynamischen Ressourcenallokation, die geeignete Parameter, wie z. B. {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistungeine an den aktuellen Zustand des drahtlosen Netzwerks an passen. Gegenw{\"a}rtige Verfahren zur Ressourcenallokation in {WiFi} Systemen sind von sehr einfacher Struktur und beschr{\"a}nken sich auf die Anpassung genau eines Parameters innerhalb der Funk{\"u}bertragung. {\"U}bliche Praxis ist das Festsetzen einer statischen und vergleichsweise hohen Sendeleistung f{\"u}r alle zu {\"u}bertragenden Datenpakete. Praktische Verfahren zur dynamischen und verteilten Sendeleistungsregelung auf der physikalischen Schicht ({PHY-layer)} des {IEEE} 802.11 Standards gibt es derzeit nicht. Gleichwohl versprechen solche Allokationsschemen, die pro Paket bzw. pro Kommunikationsverbindung gezielt Ressourcen zuweisen k{\"o}nnen, eine wesentliche Steigerung der Gesamtdatenrate innerhalb eines drahtlosen Netzwerks. Jedoch steigen mit ihnen typischerweise die Komplexit{\"a}t und auch der Informationsbedarf aus h{\"o}heren Netzwerkschichten, wie beispielsweise der aktuelle Status des Medienzugriffs aus der Schicht zur Medienzugriffssteuerung ({MAC-layer).} Deshalb sind derartige Ans{\"a}tze, trotz ihres in theoretischen Arbeiten belegten Potentials zur Leistungssteigerung, in praktischen {WiFi} Systemen weitgehend unerforscht. Der Schwerpunkt dieser wissenschaftlichen Arbeit liegt auf der Analyse zur Realisierbarkeit und zur Leistungsf{\"a}higkeit einer gemeinsamen Regelung von {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistung pro Kommunikationsverbindung unter Verwendung realer {IEEE} 802.11 Hardware. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir das Linux mac80211 Subsystem erweitert, so dass eine schicht{\"u}bergreifende (cross-layer) Kommunikation {\"u}ber die Sendeleistung pro Datenpaket zwischen {PHY-layer} und {MAC-layer} erm{\"o}glicht wird. Im n{\"a}chsten Schritt haben wir analysiert, inwieweit die relevanten Regelungsparameter {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistung in unserem Forschungsnetzwerk {``Berlin} Open Wireless Lab ({BOWL)''} parametrisierbar sind und welche Wechselwirkungen zwischen ihnen bestehen. Auf der Grundlage unserer Atheros {WiFi} Hardware entwickelten wir das neues Monitoringtool {``RegMon''} f{\"u}r verschiedene Linux Kernel Treiber. Mit dessen Hilfe k{\"o}nnen wir die dynamischen Vorg{\"a}nge auf dem {PHY-layer}, als auch auf dem {MAC-layer} der {WLAN} Netzwerkarte mit hoher zeitlichen Aufl{\"o}sung analysieren, auswerten und zur Fehlerdiagnose nutzen. In der vorliegenden Arbeit haben wir den verteilten Algorithmus {``Minstrel-Blues''} zur dynamischen Ressourcenallokation von {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistung entwickelt und implementiert. Unser Algorithmus basiert auf der Auswertung lokaler Statistiken, die Paketerfolgswahrscheinlichkeiten aktiv getesteter Kombinationen aus {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistung beinhalten. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus werden keine zus{\"a}tzlichen Informationen wie {z.B.} die Signalst{\"a}rke der empfangenen Pakete oder Kanalzustandsbeschreibungen ben{\"o}tigt. Tats{\"a}chlich funktioniert Minstrel-Blues auf jeder beliebigen {IEEE} 802.11 Hardware, die eine Unterst{\"u}tzung zur Regelung der {\"U}bertragungsrate und Sendeleistung pro Datenpaket bietet. Unter Berechnung einer additiven Nutzenfunktion, die sich aus dem aktuellen Datendurchsatz und der notwendigen Sendeleistung pro unterst{\"u}tzter Datenrate zusammensetzt, entscheidet Minstrel-Blues welche Kombination aus Datenrate und Sendeleistung die h{\"o}chste Pr{\"a}ferenz erh{\"a}lt. Um die Auswirkungen des Zielkonflikts zwischen der Maximierung des Datendurchsatzes und der Minimierung der Interferenz im Funknetzwerk analysieren zu k{\"o}nnen, haben wir einen Gewichtungsfaktor in unsere Nutzenfunktion integriert. Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass ein auf die Maximierung des Datendurchsatzes gewichteter Minstrel-Blues in der Lage ist, die f{\"u}r einen gleichbleibenden Datendurchsatz notwendig Sendeleistung, im Vergleich zur maximalen Sendeleistung, signifikant zu verringern. Diese spezielle Funktionsweise bezeichnen wir als {``Minstrel-Piano''.} Basierend auf unseren Experimenten in {BOWL}, konnten wir bei der Nutzung des 5 {GHz} {ISM} Frequenzbandes ({IEEE} 802.11a) belegen, dass Minstrel-Piano den Gesamtdurchsatz des Datenverkehrs im Funknetzwerk, aufgrund seiner effizienterer Nutzung des Frequenzspektrums, ma{\ss}geblich erh{\"o}ht. Unsere Analyse endet mit experimentellen Untersuchungen zu unterschiedlichen Gewichtungsfaktoren in einer typischen {WiFI} Umgebenung im Heimnetzwerk, bestehend aus zwei Laptops und einer {WLAN} Basisstation. Anhand dessen konnten wir zeigen, dass unsere dynamische Regelung von Datenrate und Sendeleistung auch im lizenzfreien 2,4 {GHz} Frequenzspektrum gut funktioniert. Mit steigender Dichte von {WiFi} Ger{\"a}ten und der kontinuierlichen Vergr{\"o}{\ss}erung der genutzten Bandbreite, durch die aktuellen Standards {IEEE} 802.11 n und 802.11 ac, gehen wir davon aus, dass eine dynamische Ressourcenallokation eine Schl{\"u}sselrolle zur effizienten Nutzung des Spektrum bzw. zum Interferenzmanagement einnehmen wird. Zu diesem Zweck leistet diese Dissertations einen entscheidenden Beitrag zum theoretischen Verst{\"a}ndnis und der praktischen Umsetzung einer dynamischen Regelung von {\"U}bertragungsrate, Sendeleistung und Carrier Sensing in {IEEE} 802.11 Systemen.},

	Abstract = {Even though hot spots and mesh networks increasingly realize the long-standing
    vision of ubiquitous Internet access, our understanding of wireless protocols
    and system is still in its infancy. To analyze and debug the current and new
    protocols, packet-level accurate information of protocol status is crucially
    needed. Thus, this paper introduces PaPMo (Packet accurate Protocol Monitor),
    an active monitoring tool that captures snapshots of the protocol status as
    packets pass through the different layers and over distributed nodes. By merging
    and correlating the captured information, PaPMo is able to provide packet-level
    accurate information of deployed wireless network behavior that is currently
    available only via simulations. We show that PaPMo is able to correlate MAC-layer
    events, such as packet loss due to queue overflow, with TCP congestion control
    behavior at the accuracy of microseconds and with high fidelity.

The good news is that initial deployments of WiFi meshes show the feasibility of providing ubiquitous Internet connectivity. However, their performance is far below the necessary and achievable limit. Moreover, users subscription in the existing meshes is dismal even though the technical challenges to get connectivity are low. This paper provides an overview of the current status of mesh networks deployment and highlights the technical, economical and social challenges that need to be addressed in the next years. As proof of principle study, we discuss the above mentioned challenges with reference to three real networks: (i) MagNets, an operator-driven planned two-tier mesh network; (ii) Berlin Freifunk network as a pure community-driven, single-tier network; (iii) Weimar Freifunk network, also a community-driven but two-tier network.},

	Abstract = {A substantial variety of control algorithms to adjust carrier sensing, transmission power, and transmission rate have been proposed for {IEEE} 802.11 wireless networks in the recent literature. Their objectives range from maximizing throughput, spatial reuse, and fairness to minimizing interference and congestion within the network. However, only a few of these have been implemented and analysed in practice, often because accessing and changing the necessary parameters in the wireless hardware is too difficult. Essentially, there is little understanding about the interactions of jointly adjusted transmission rate, power and carrier sense thresholds, and their impact on the aforementioned objectives. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on transmission rate, power and carrier sensing settings. We provide a detailed description of the common {IEEE} 802.11 radio hardware, especially in terms of carrier-sensing circuitry. We then present our results from our validation and initial measurement study, which demonstrate interactions between transmit power and rate under different carrier-sensing settings in a two link scenario. Our initial findings indicate there exists a limited number of rate-power combinations that achieve high performance in terms of either throughput and fairness both with and without carrier sensing. Furthermore, in the case of both strong and weak links exist in the network, turning carrier sensing off significantly improves performance.},

	Abstract = {Spectral efficiency has been a major focus of research in wireless networks. Recent theoretical work has shown that ideal medium access protocol using optimal power control can improve channel utilization by up to a factor of √ρ, where ρ is the density of nodes in the region [1]. Although power control mechanisms have been extensively studied in theory and simulations, their practical evaluation has not been done throughly. Most of the power control mechanisms proposed in literature [3, 4, 5] assume a very fine grained handle on transmit power of wireless nodes and exercise this control to provide sophisticated mechanisms of sharing wireless medium among competing flows. In this work, we investigate the (in)feasibility of fine-grained power control in wireless networks using real testbed experiments. We perform detailed experiments to highlight fundamental issues with power control mechanisms, that cannot be captured by using a network simulator. Our experiments indicate that fine grained power control may not be a viable solution for indoor wireless networks and most power control mechanisms may need to be adapted to be suitable for practical settings.},
